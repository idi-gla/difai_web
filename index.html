![Human-AI Shared Autonomy](https://youtu.be/cMV89ojnfxk)

The *Designing Interaction Freedom via Active Inference (DIFAI)* project is an ERC Advanced Grant, led by [**Rod Murray-Smith**](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~rod/) and which started on 1st January 2024. 
The project was selected by the ERC (proposal 101097708) and was funded by the UK Horizon guarantee scheme as EPSRC project  [EP/Y029178/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FY029178%2F1).

*Problem:*
Reliable design of interactive systems using advanced sensors and machine learning (ML) is an unsolved
problem. New sensors could expand how we interact with computers, but are still hard to design for,
without overly constraining user behaviour.
AI algorithms can reduce human workload, but can fail in complex contexts and can control, deskill and
dis-empower people. We have no principled workflows for designing interaction to allow users to flexibly
share autonomy with supporting AI.

*Objectives:*
Integrate Active Inference theory into the human-computer interaction loop, linking human behaviour via
sensors and ML/inference embeddings with dynamic mediating mechanisms to create end-to-end mutually
adaptive loops between humans and systems.
Develop novel interaction mechanisms for explicit and implicit control of AI autonomy levels to empower
people via shared autonomy, while maintaining their agency.
Create systematic, composable software tools for computational interaction design which support prototyping
and analysis of ML-infused sensors coupled with humans, which can integrate probabilistic causal
models to solve inverse problems with advanced sensors, adapting to closed-loop data.

*Impact:*
Using ML to give users freedom to express themselves individually, we can be robust to user heterogeneity,
ensure fairness for diverse users and enable creative uses of technologies. Our tools will form
the foundation of future usable interfaces with novel sensors and rich data spaces, and advances can be
shared and rapidly built on, transforming HCI research workflows.
Applications: 1. Whole hand touch interaction via soft, programmable

# Brief description

The approach taken is based on three main pillars:

1. Active inference:

2. Optimal Mechanism Design:

# Vacancies
<!-- *Internships*
Call for internships with the DIFAI project at the University of Glasgow.


*Task:*
The visit should be a chance to work together with the DIFAI team on a topic that is of mutual interest to both the Glasgow and student’s home group. This is likely to take place in  the spring/summer/ autumn of 2026, but we can be flexible.

*Funding:*
Each internship (assuming a 3 months stay) can get up to £3500 towards extra expenses or  flights associated with a visit or a stipend.

*Eligibility:* 
Students must be current Ph.D. students at an established Computational Interaction or Active inference research group. 
We cannot support visa applications for foreign applicants, but if you are studying in the UK at an accredited institution like the University of Glasgow for less than six months, you can potentially do this as a visitor. Many students (including those from the European Union and other eligible countries) won’t need a visa for visits lasting less than six months. Check if you need a visa to study in the UK. 

*Application process:*
Please send an application which includes your c.v., evidence of your current Ph.D. position and a link to your research group, and possible topics you would be interested in working on that are associated with the DIFAI project’s research topics.
Send the application by 31st July to [Roderick.Murray-Smith@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:Roderick.Murray-Smith@glasgow.ac.uk) 

We will review proposals within a week of the deadline, and get back to successful candidates to adapt the research plan and discuss the details of the visit.
