The *Designing Interaction Freedom via Active Inference (DIFAI)* project is an ERC Advanced Grant, led by [**Rod Murray-Smith**](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~rod/) and which started on 1st January 2024. 
The project was selected by the ERC (proposal 101097708) and was funded by the UK Horizon guarantee scheme as EPSRC project  [EP/Y029178/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FY029178%2F1).

*Problem:*
Reliable design of interactive systems using advanced sensors and machine learning (ML) is an unsolved
problem. New sensors could expand how we interact with computers, but are still hard to design for,
without overly constraining user behaviour.
AI algorithms can reduce human workload, but can fail in complex contexts and can control, deskill and
dis-empower people. We have no principled workflows for designing interaction to allow users to flexibly
share autonomy with supporting AI.

*Objectives:*
Integrate Active Inference theory into the human-computer interaction loop, linking human behaviour via
sensors and ML/inference embeddings with dynamic mediating mechanisms to create end-to-end mutually
adaptive loops between humans and systems.
Develop novel interaction mechanisms for explicit and implicit control of AI autonomy levels to empower
people via shared autonomy, while maintaining their agency.
Create systematic, composable software tools for computational interaction design which support prototyping
and analysis of ML-infused sensors coupled with humans, which can integrate probabilistic causal
models to solve inverse problems with advanced sensors, adapting to closed-loop data.

*Impact:*
Using ML to give users freedom to express themselves individually, we can be robust to user heterogeneity,
ensure fairness for diverse users and enable creative uses of technologies. Our tools will form
the foundation of future usable interfaces with novel sensors and rich data spaces, and advances can be
shared and rapidly built on, transforming HCI research workflows.
Applications: 1. Whole hand touch interaction via soft, programmable

# Brief description

The approach taken is based on three main pillars:

1. Active inference:

2. Optimal Mechanism Design:
